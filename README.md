# TaskBoardScriptlet
Problem: Our distributed team wanted to see a Task Board based on our JIRA tickets.  Due to circumstances beyond our control, it was not possible to install the Agile plug in to our JIRA instance.

Solution:  Create a JavaScript bookmarklet that will examine the JIRA tasklist on screen and create a stacked column chart broken down across comon categories with each block in the column representing a single JIRA ticket.

Hotw to Install: Drag this link to your bookmark bar:  [to-be-done-later]
